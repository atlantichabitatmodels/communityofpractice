The wood turtle, *Glyptemys insculpta*, is listed as threatened federally in Canada and provincially in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Historic surveying for *G. insculpta* in these provinces has been arbitrary and geographic knowledge gaps persist. To address these gaps, Thomas developed species distribution models for NS and NB using Maxent software, *G. insculpta* occurrence data, and environmental data relevant to the species’ ecology. 

These models indicated that important environmental variables for predicting *G. insculpta* distribution included ‘Elevation’, ‘Distance to Alder’, and ‘Watercourse Density’, among others. The model outputs were applied to field-survey planning in 2021 and 2022, resulting in new *G. insculpta* occurrences at twelve sites across NS and NB.
