## Community of Practice Monthly Meetings
### Upcoming Meeting Themes

For the next set of meetings, we'll enjoy model showcases from community members!

Do you have a model to showcase?! Please reach out to [jocelyn.pender@accdc.ca](mailto:jocelyn.pender@accdc.ca)!


To participate, I'd ask that you:
-	Make your modelling code or workflow available to the community of practice
-	Provide us with enough context to understand your workflow and modelling decisions
-	Write a blog post for our website, including but not limited to model metadata and a few sentences about the model product (optional, but very valuable)
-	Your model(s) can be at the beginning stages, in progress or complete!

#### May 2023

Jordy Thomson from DFO (Fisheries and Oceans Canada) will walk us through the eelgrass SDM his team developed using the biomod2 package for R! He will describe the environmental data layers, presence-absence observations and model context.
This presentation is contingent upon fieldwork demands. In the event that Jordy cannot make this session, Jocelyn will present recent modelling work conducted by the team at AC CDC (Atlantic Canada Conservation Data Centre).
