## Community of Practice Monthly Meetings

Note: **This is NOT a lecture series!** Our monthly meeting is an evolving format focused on *community building* and connecting people within the group (i.e., our focus is not on presenting content or delivering training like a lecture series might be). 

### March Meeting

**March session goals:**
* Continue community building through several short talks and networking
* Establish working groups. See working group agenda [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_izUyuh_66MM1f1fQevr5cMiBpIW3O5HghgwWHRjEuA/edit?usp=sharing).

**Agenda:**
* Welcome (5 mins)
* Four ‘Get to Know the Participants’ talks (30 mins). Please contact me if you'd like to deliver a talk during the March session!
* Question period for ‘Get to Know the Participants’ talks in breakout rooms (20 mins)
* Introduction to working group meeting format (5 mins)
* Break (5 mins). Folks who do not wish to be working groups members are invited to leave.
* Working groups sessions on [gather.town](https://app.gather.town/invite?token=2JlYYy_PO1PoNuevTkLz7iFn9oGlOjO_) (50 mins)
* Wrap up (5 mins)
