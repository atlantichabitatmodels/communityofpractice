## Community of Practice Monthly Meetings

### February 2024

We are looking forward to reconnecting with everyone on February 23rd from 2 to 4 pm. A meeting invite is coming soon!
### Upcoming Meeting Themes

For the next set of meetings, we'll enjoy model showcases from community members!

Do you have a model to showcase?! Please reach out to [pender.jocelyn@gmail.com](mailto:pender.jocelyn@gmail.com)!


To participate, I'd ask that you:
-	Make your modelling code or workflow available to the community of practice
-	Provide us with enough context to understand your workflow and modelling decisions
-	Write a blog post for our website, including but not limited to model metadata and a few sentences about the model product (optional, but very valuable)
-	Your model(s) can be at the beginning stages, in progress or complete!

<!---#### June 2023
**Cancelled**


Community member Rob Cameron (Dalhousie University) will visit us!

##### Exploring Ecological Questions with SDMs: 3 examples using lichens
SDMs are not only useful for predicting species distribution but also for answering important ecological questions.  We will look at 3 examples of lichen studies that use SDMs to explore ecological patterns and processes. The first example uses SDMs to look at niche differentiation in 4 sympatric species of lichen.  The second example looks at assessing threats to conservation of 2 lichens and third example looks at predicting lichen rich ecosystems.--->
