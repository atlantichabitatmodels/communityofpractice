## March meeting

**March session goals:**
* Continue community building through several short talks and networking
* Establish working groups. More specifically:
	* Determine who needs to be involved in each working group (i.e., key contributors who may be absent from this March meeting)
	* Determine how the working groups will work together. Will they work together during Community of Practice meetings? Will they meet outside of Community of Practice meetings?
	* Decide what the groups will tackle first. 
	* Establish shared leadership within the groups. 

**Agenda:**
* Welcome (5 mins)
* Four ‘Get to Know the Participants’ talks (30 mins). Please contact me if you'd like to deliver a talk during the March session!
* Question period for ‘Get to Know the Participants’ talks in breakout rooms (20 mins)
* Introduction to working group format (5 mins)
* Break (5 mins). Folks who do not wish to be working groups members are invited to leave.
* Working groups sessions on gather.town (50 mins)
* Wrap up (5 mins)
