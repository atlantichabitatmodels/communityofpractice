‘Skills building’ is an important objective of this community of practice. Who should we contact to facilitate training? Please contact [Jocelyn](team) if you, someone in your group, or another organization might have people and time to commit to delivering a 1-hour workshop to our group in the Fall.


## Goals

Our goals are to:
1. Foster community building and knowledge sharing in the Atlantic region
2. Develop best practices for habitat modelling
3. Tailor our efforts to species at risk
