## Welcome to the Atlantic Canada Species At Risk Habitat Modelling Community of Practice

{: .alert .alert-info}
The Atlantic Canada Species At Risk (SAR) Habitat Modelling Community of Practice best practices working group has developed [species distribution modelling Frequently Asked Questions](https://atlantichabitatmodels.github.io/communityofpractice/model-faqs/) in support of improved SAR modelling products in our region. We need your help to determine how to proceed with further work. Please fill out this survey to help us decide how to proceed with further work: <https://forms.gle/vxVqwgqwvGoizGAVA>.
