The Data Sharing working group was assembled in the Fall of 2022 to improve data sharing in Atlantic Canada, in support of Species At Risk model building. They have developed a [data catalogue](https://atlantichabitatmodels.github.io/data/) to help model developers find the data they need more easily.
