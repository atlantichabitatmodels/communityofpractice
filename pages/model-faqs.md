## Goals

These 'modelling best practices' will be used by the community when building models to improve outcomes for SAR:
* Improved efficiency, quality
* Appropriate use of products
* Better decision making

## Modelling Best Practices: Frequently Asked Questions

[How much species data is enough to build a robust model?]({{ '/faqs/how-much-data' | relative_url }})

[How do we determine appropriate spatial extents and cell size (model resolution)?]({{ '/faqs/spatial-extent-cell-size' | relative_url }})

[What sources (conventional and unconventional) of data can we look to in Atlantic Canada?]({{ '/faqs/data-sources' | relative_url }})

[How do we harmonize datasets across jurisdictions?]({{ '/faqs/data-harmonization' | relative_url }})
