## Goals

These 'modelling best practices' will be used by the community when building models to improve outcomes for SAR:
* Improved efficiency, quality
* Appropriate use of products
* Better decision making

## Modelling Best Practices: Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: When is it appropriate to use Topographic Position Index (TPI) as a habitat covariate? How should the data be processed for use in models (e.g., raw data? or categories?)?

#### A:
David Lieske has put together a [TPI primer document to provide guidance on when/how to use Topographic Position Index (tpi) as a habitat covariate](../assets/model-faqs/Notes-TPI.pdf).
