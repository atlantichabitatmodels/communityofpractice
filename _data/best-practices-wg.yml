    Dr. David Lieske is an Associate Professor in the Department of Geography and Environment, Mount Allison University, and a spatial modeler with expertise in Geographic Information Systems (GIS), statistics, and remote sensing – a trio of tools that have helped him cast light on the conditions that have driven changes in both birds (falcons, ducks, seabirds) and mammals (elk), as well as the blacklegged tick – a species of special concern given its role in the spread of Lyme disease. Lieske’s work in wildlife modelling is recognized nationally and internationally.
